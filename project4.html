    <h1>Title about Clustering</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="paper">Explain clustering</p>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/customer-segmentation-clustering/data">Link to Dataset</a>
    <p class="paper">Introduce and explain data</p>
    <p class="paper">The dataset contains customer profiles that can be used to (talk about using them for marketing and stuff)
        Some of the features are customer birth year, number of children or teens living with the customer, the customer's income,
        how long since the last transaction, the amount spent on one of several categories of product (wine, fruit, meat, fish, sweet, and "gold"),
        the number of purchases made through the website or physical store, and whether the customer accepted specific marketing campaigns.

    <p class="paper">Discuss pre-processing</p>
    <p class="paper">Dropped education, marital status, and customer date for being non-numeric and difficult to implement for clustering</p>
    <p class="paper">The first columns dropped were ID, Z_CostContact, and Z_Revenue, as none of these provide specific information. All "AcceptedCMP"
        columns, recording whether the customer accepted a marketing campaign, were dropped due to all being present in less than 25% of the records.
        Complain and Response columns were also dropped due to low prevalence. Columns on number of kids and teens living with the customer were removed due to low variance.
        Education, marital status, and customer join date were dropped for being non-numeric and more difficult to parameterize for clustering.
        Finally, 24 records were then dropped for having no value for income. One record where the income was entered as 666666 was removed for being multiple
        times larger than the next-highest income, potentially skewing results.

    <h2>Modeling</h2>
    <p class="paper">Explain k-clustering and why I chose it</p>
    <p class="paper">Insert images and describe clusters</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p class="paper">Discuss impact</p>
    <p class="paper">For the company, positive impact of more targeted marketing potentially leading to higher revenue. Can focus on customers more likely to spend more.</p>
    <p class="paper">For the customer, arguable positive impact of better recommendations.</p>
    <p class="paper">Negative impact about profiling users and information risk.</p>
    <p class="paper">Nuance over whether better advertising is a net good or bad for end user.</p>
