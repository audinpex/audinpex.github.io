    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="paper">Something about phishing</p>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winson13/dataset-for-link-phishing-detection">Link to Dataset</a></p>
    <p class="paper">The dataset has a bunch of analysis about urls and their characteristics as well as whether they are a phishing link or not</p>
    <p class="paper">Pre-processing: no nulls, removed unexplained first column, actual url, some fields that were 0 for all entries, and cleaned up "domain_with_copyright".
        Idk what it was but it was inconsistent between integers 1 and 0 and the strings one, zero, One, and Zero. [maybe insert code screenie]</p>
    <h2>Model</h2>
    <p class="paper">I did forest because it seemed best. Naive Bayes could have worked with total_of_symbol variables but it would have been harder to set up. SVM would
        be better with variables that were more consistantly above zero. Explain why KNN is stupid here.</p>
    <p class="paper">Explain my metrics</p>
    <p class="paper">Storytelling????? I guess????? Idk get metrics on most important variables ig</p>
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p class="paper">As useful as improved phishing detection could be, it is not without risk. The benefits of
        improved phishing detection algorithms are making client-side programs more effective at blocking these sites,
        helping email clients sort out emails with phishing links from emails with legitimate links, and potentially helping
        end users better identify what makes a link or url more likely to be unsafe. However, if this were to reach
        phishers, they could use the information gained from this research to "improve" their links and make them harder to recognize.
        This does not make these results irrelevant, the continued presence of older variants of malware in addition to new threats
        makes it likely that even as some phishers change their urls to avoid detection, many will still be blocked.
