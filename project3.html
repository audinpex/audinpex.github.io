    <h2>Experiment 1: All Continuous Features, Rows with Nulls Dropped</h2>
    <p class="paper">In my first experiment, I used all of the numeric features from the dataset. Any rows with null values
        were dropped for this experiment, about 300 rows. I wanted to see how well using all features predicted the data.
    </p>
    <p class="paper">The coefficient of determination, the [explain], for this model was 0.799. [explain what that means.]
        The mean squared error, the [explain], for this model was 1,588,229,760.73. [what is this]. The root mean squared error was
        39,852.60. This represents that the average distance between a data point's estimated value based on the model and
        the actual value is 39,852.60. [explain context]
    </p>
    <h2>Experiment 2: All Continuous Features, Columns with Nulls Dropped</h2>
    <p class="paper">The second experiment used most of the same features as the first experiment. However, instead of dropping
        rows with missing values, I dropped the two columns with the largest number of missing values: MasVnrType and BsmtExposure.
        I also deleted the three rows with missing values in the column MasVnrArea. I chose to try this to see if having more records
        would be more beneficial than having the additional features.
    </p>
    <p class="paper">The coefficient of determination for this model was 0.848. The mean squared error was 930,983,000.66 and
        the root mean squared error was 30,512.02. [talk about hwo this is a lot better]
